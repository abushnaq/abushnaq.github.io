title: "Cells In a Range - LeetCode Problem"
---

This post is in reference to the [Cells in a range on an excel sheet](https://leetcode.com/problems/cells-in-a-range-on-an-excel-sheet/submissions/1471352252/) LeetCode problem.

_TL;DR_: You are given a starting and ending cell and are expected to return all the cells that are in range in between. This problem is classified as easy on LeetCode.

The reason for this post is not really to discuss the problem in detail because it is fairly straightforward but more to make sure that I can post correctly, that my markdown works well, and to get in the habit of talking about code. You gotta start somewhere.

_Your input_: A string with the format "_StartColumnStartRow_:_EndColumnEndRow_"(e.g. A3:B7).

_First things first_: Split the initial string to get the starting and ending row/column:
```
var cells = s.split(separator:":")
```

`cells` is now an array of two strings(["A3", "B7"] following our example above).


Next for each element in the array, you need to get the row and column. There are two ways to do this:

1. Take the result of the `split` call above then call the `first` and `last` properties on that value. This is possible because in Swift all strings are collections. Note that the properties return an `Optional` type and so you need to make sure you unwrap it:
```
        var startingColumn = ""
        if let _sC = cells[0].first
        {
            startingColumn = String(_sC)
        }
        var endingColumn = ""
        if let _eC = cells[1].first
        {
            endingColumn = String(_eC)
        }

        var startingRow = ""
        if let _sR = cells[0].last
        {
            startingRow = String(_sR)
        }
        var endingRow = ""
        if let _eR = cells[1].last
        {
            endingRow = String(_eR)
        }
```
This was the approach I went with in my LeetCode submission.
2. This second approach is one I thought of while writing this post. If you pass an empty string to the `split` call it will give you individual characters from that string.

Once you have your rows and columns, you need to iterate through characters and numbers to get your range. One of the mentioned  pre-conditions in this problem is that all characters are going to be upper English and numbers are only going from one to nine. This makes it a little bit easier and makes ranges a little bit easier to work with.

First, we define all of our characters and numbers as a long string. This lets us take advantage of the fact that in Swift strings are collections so you can iterate over the contents of a string and get at individual characters that way. 

```
    let chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    let nums = "123456789"
```

Then we start on a loop that goes through the character array. Every time we go through the loop, we check to see if we encountered our first starting column, and if we did, we set a flag. The goal of this flag is to let us know that we can run the loop for rows for each column we find from this point forward. We follow similar logic in the loop for rows.

Two important details - the flag for the rows needs to be reset after the row loop is done so we can run through the loop again for the next column. Also after you run the row loop, you check the column value to see if you're on the end column so you can stop. You need to do this _after_ the row loop to account for cases where your start and end column are identical and you go down a number of rows.



Submitted solution below. 

```Swift
class Solution {
    let chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    let nums = "123456789"
    func cellsInRange(_ s: String) -> [String] {
        var cells = s.split(separator:":")
        var startingColumn = ""
        if let _sC = cells[0].first
        {
            startingColumn = String(_sC)
        }
        var endingColumn = ""
        if let _eC = cells[1].first
        {
            endingColumn = String(_eC)
        }

        var startingRow = ""
        if let _sR = cells[0].last
        {
            startingRow = String(_sR)
        }
        var endingRow = ""
        if let _eR = cells[1].last
        {
            endingRow = String(_eR)
        }
        
        var result = [String]()
        var foundStartingColumn = false
        var foundStartingRow = false
        for char in chars
        {
            guard String(char) == startingColumn 
                || foundStartingColumn else { continue }
            foundStartingColumn = true
            for num in nums
            {
                guard String(num) == startingRow 
                    || foundStartingRow else { continue }
                var foundStartingRow = false
                
                result.append("\(char)\(num)")
                if String(num) == endingRow  
                { 
                    break 
                }
            }
            var foundStartingRow = false
            if String(char) == endingColumn  
            { 
                break 
            }
        }
        return result
    }
}
```
