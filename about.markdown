I am a builder of teams, processes, and apps navigating this world with a family, a cat, and a bird. 

In past lives my code has lived in The Weather Channel app, Weather Underground app, and many station apps. I enjoy learning new things, making new things, and reading the latest sci-fi book I can put my hands on.

In the outside world I fight a battle with weeds in my yard that has had more twists and turns than The Skywalker Saga and all the Star Trek movies and shows put together.

This site is one of the recent things I've learned through Jekyll. I'm also tackling LeetCode challenges as I'm able to in order to keep my brain in line. :)
